What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","\n","- >Interpreted Languages:\n","\n","  Code is executed line-by-line using an interpreter.\n","\n","  Slower compared to compiled languages as each line is processed at runtime.\n","\n","Example languages :  Python, JavaScript, Ruby.\n","\n","\n","- >Compiled Languages:\n","\n","   Code is converted into machine code by a compiler before execution.\n","\n","   Faster execution as the machine code is directly executed by the CPU.\n","\n","Example languages : C, C++, Java (compiled into bytecode, then interpreted by JVM).\n","\n","2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","\n","  Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors in a program without terminating it unexpectedly.\n","\n","  In Python, exceptions are handled using:\n","\n","  try: Defines a block of code to monitor for errors.\n","\n","  except: Handles the exception if it occurs.\n","\n","  else: Executes if no exception occurs.\n","\n","  finally: Executes regardless of whether an exception occurs (used for cleanup).\n","\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","\n"," The finally block is used to define code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred in the try block.\n"," Commonly used for cleanup tasks, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n","\n","\n","\n","4. What is logging in Python?\n","\n"," Logging is a process of recording events, warnings, and errors that occur during program execution.\n","Python's logging module allows developers to track program behavior, debug errors, and generate log files.\n","\n"," It supports various levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n","\n","\n","5. What is the significance of the _del_ method in Python?\n","\n"," The _del_ method is a special method in Python called when an object is about to be destroyed.Useful for resource cleanup tasks, such as closing database connections or files.\n","\n","\n","6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","\n"," import: Imports the entire module, requiring you to prefix module names when accessing functions or classes.\n","\n"," from ... import: Imports specific functions, classes, or variables, allowing direct usage.\n","\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","\n"," Use a tuple to handle multiple exceptions in a single except block.\n","\n","\n","\n","8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","\n"," The with statement simplifies file handling by automatically managing resources, such as closing files.\n"," Ensures that the file is closed after the block execution, even if an exception occurs.\n","\n","\n","\n","9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","\n","- >Multithreading:\n","\n"," Multiple threads within the same process share the same memory space.\n","\n"," Useful for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file reading, web scraping).\n","\n","\n","- >Multiprocessing:\n","\n"," Each process has its own memory space, making it ideal for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., computations).\n"," Avoids the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.\n","\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","\n"," Tracks program flow and errors.\n","\n"," Useful for debugging and monitoring in production environments.\n","\n"," Allows categorization of messages by severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).\n","\n","\n","\n","11. What is memory management in Python?\n","\n"," Python uses automatic memory management with a combination of reference counting and garbage collection.\n","\n"," Objects are removed from memory when their reference count drops to zero.\n","\n"," Garbage collection handles cyclic references.\n","\n","\n","\n","12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","\n"," Try block: Code where an exception might occur.\n","\n"," Except block: Handles the exception if it occurs.\n","\n"," Else block: Executes when no exception occurs in the try block.\n","\n"," Finally block: Executes cleanup code regardless of an exception.\n","\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n","\n"," Efficient memory management ensures optimal utilization of system resources, preventing memory leaks and ensuring program stability.\n","\n"," Python automates memory allocation and deallocation using a combination of reference counting and garbage collection, which reduces the burden on developers.\n","\n"," Without proper memory management, unused objects may consume resources, leading to slower performance or crashes.\n","\n","\n","\n","14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","\n"," try block: Contains the code that might raise an exception.\n","\n"," except block: Handles the exception and prevents the program from crashing.\n","\n"," Together, they allow developers to anticipate and respond to runtime errors.\n","\n","\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","\n"," Python uses reference counting to track the number of references to an object. When the count drops to zero, the memory is deallocated.\n","\n"," Additionally, Pythonâ€™s garbage collector detects and cleans up cyclic references (objects referring to each other).\n","\n"," Developers can manually invoke garbage collection using the gc module:\n"," import gc\n"," gc.collect()\n","\n","\n","\n","16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n"," The else block executes if no exceptions are raised in the try block.\n","\n"," It is used to define code that should only run when the try block succeeds.\n","\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","\n"," DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic information.\n","\n"," INFO: General information about program execution.\n","\n"," WARNING: An indication of potential problems.\n","\n"," ERROR: A serious issue that prevents execution of part of the program.\n","\n"," CRITICAL: A severe error causing program failure.\n","\n","\n","18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","\n"," os.fork():\n","\n"," Creates a new process by duplicating the current process.\n","\n"," Available only on Unix-like systems.\n","\n"," Requires manual management of resources and process synchronization.\n","\n","\n","- >Multiprocessing:\n","\n","  A higher-level library for creating and managing processes.\n","\n","  Works on all platforms and provides features like process pools and inter-process communication.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n"," Prevents data loss by ensuring all changes are saved to the file.\n","\n"," Frees up system resources.\n","\n"," Avoids file corruption and ensures other processes can access the file.\n","\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","\n"," file.read(): Reads the entire content of the file as a single string.\n","\n"," file.readline(): Reads one line from the file at a time.\n","\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","\n"," The logging module provides a flexible framework for logging messages during program execution.\n","\n"," It helps in debugging, tracking events, and monitoring production systems.\n","\n"," Logs can be directed to files, consoles, or remote servers.\n","\n","\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","\n"," The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system, including file handling tasks such as:\n","\n"," Checking if a file exists (os.path.exists()).\n","\n"," Renaming or deleting files (os.rename(), os.remove()).\n","\n"," Creating and navigating directories (os.mkdir(), os.chdir()).\n","\n","\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","\n"," Cyclic references: Objects referring to each other may not be immediately garbage collected.\n","\n"," Memory leaks: Improper use of global variables or long-lived objects can lead to memory not being freed.\n","\n"," Inefficiency: Automatic memory management may be slower compared to manual management in certain situations.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","\n"," Use the raise statement to throw an exception.\n","\n"," Example:\n","\n","age = -5\n","if age < 0:\n","    raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative!\")\n","\n","\n","25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","\n"," Multithreading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently within a single process, making programs more efficient.\n","\n"," Useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as file reading or network requests, where threads can work while waiting for resources.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"P4ygygRzaP0j"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"IU-zbjzvKUmt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
